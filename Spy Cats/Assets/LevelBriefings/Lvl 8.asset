  briefingText: "Agent, you\u2019ll need to be very careful with this mission. Our
    intel is showing us that a gem should be within this pyramid, but there are plenty
    of ancient booby traps and obstacles that could take those 9 lives of yours down
    to 0. There are also rumors that there is an ancient secret from Anubis, the
    god of the dead, that could greatly help you within here. "
